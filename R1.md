### R1D1 ~ Sunday

##### (Day 1: March 29, 2020)

**Today's Progress**: Working on my Ruby proficiency test. Currently following the a/A Intro to Ruby courses.

**Thoughts:** Having the core programming concepts well packed, has helped me transition from Javascript to Ruby in a very intuative way. I've been searching for methods of solving a problem that save me time and head space.

### R1D2 ~ Monday

##### (Day 2: March 29, 2020 )

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Enumerables and Ranges part of the Ruby II course.

**Thoughts:** Found myself stuck multiple times. I need to make sure I learn every tool and method to my disposal. Also think about creative ways to implement them. Ruby is a very powerful language. The more I keep on programming and seeing diffrent ways to solve a problem. The more I start to like it!

### R1D1

##### (Day 1: March 29, 2020)

**Today's Progress**: Working on my Ruby proficiency test. Currently following the a/A Intro to Ruby courses.

**Thoughts:** Having the core programming concepts well packed, has helped me transition from Javascript to Ruby in a very intuative way. I've been searching for methods of solving a problem that save me time and head space.

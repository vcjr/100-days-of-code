# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
March 29th, 2020

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will put a link to my Wakatime profile so that anyone can see my progress for the day. Or a screenshot.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
